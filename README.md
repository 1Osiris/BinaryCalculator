# BinaryCalculator
 On the night of December 24th I decided to create a binary to Decimal calculator for fun. This repository will track my code's progress and anything else the comes out of it

I coded and commented two versions of the Binary calculator
> - one with an integer input
> 
> - one with a string input 
> 
> - I also played around with github branching. I think I am starting to get the hang of some things.
Merry Christmas!!!!
